# Polish and Polish-accented English dictation in Handy

## Practical recommendation

Start with **NVIDIA Canary 1B v2** for Polish dictation and bilingual Polish/English work in [Handy](https://handy.computer/), if it is available in your installed model catalog. This recommendation comes from the trainer's local trials recorded on 20 October 2026. It is a useful starting point, not a demonstrated universal winner for Polish accents.

Compare it with **Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3** and a multilingual **Whisper** model on the same recordings before choosing your daily model. Distinguish English spoken with a Polish accent from Polish speech translated into English: these are different tasks.

## What the sources establish

- [NVIDIA's Canary 1B v2 model card](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/canary-1b-v2) confirms Polish and English transcription, plus translation between English and the other supported languages. The original Canary 1B and Canary 1B v2 have different language coverage; select **v2**.
- [NVIDIA's Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 model card](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3#performance) reports Polish WER of **7.31% on FLEURS** and **7.28% on MLS**. Lower WER means fewer word errors. Those scores do not measure Polish-accented English or punctuation quality.
- The checked Canary card reports **8.40% WER averaged across 25 FLEURS languages**, not a Polish-only score. The previous note's **6.64% Polish FLEURS** and **8.77% Polish MLS** figures were not verified in that card and should not be used to claim a Polish benchmark win.
- [Handy's model manager](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/blob/main/src-tauri/src/managers/model.rs) contains a migration reference for Canary 1B v2 to `handy-computer/canary-1b-v2-gguf`. Catalog contents, quantizations and accelerators depend on the app version; this source is not proof that every released build offers the same choices.

Multilingual training makes accent robustness a reasonable hypothesis, but the checked sources do not provide a controlled Polish-accented English comparison. English-only models are not automatically unsuitable for accented English.

## Local observations from 20 October

The earlier notes describe Handy 0.9.8 on Ubuntu with a GTX 1650 (4 GB), using Canary 1B v2 Q5_K_M. These observations were not rerun during the source review:

- The trainer reported no noticed errors in one natural Polish passage, including diacritics and the model name. There is no retained reference audio or scored comparison in this repository, so this is not a measured 0% WER result.
- Polish speech produced English output when English was selected, even with translation shown as disabled. A model-name substitution occurred. Treat this as observed behavior of that setup, not a supported configuration recipe for other versions.
- Switching languages within one recording reportedly truncated output. Starting a fresh recording after switching languages was a practical workaround; the proposed attention/decoder explanation was not established.
- The notes reported transcription in under a second and approximately 1.24 GB total GPU memory. Audio duration, repeated timings and isolated process measurements were not retained. The previous 0% CPU and thermal-efficiency claims are not established; 1.24 GB is also about 31% of 4 GB, not 51%.

## Participant workflow

1. For Polish text, choose Polish transcription and check that translation is disabled. Record a short sample before dictating a long prompt.
2. For English output, test English transcription and Polish-to-English translation separately using the controls supported by your installed version. Selecting English alone is not a portable translation instruction.
3. Use a fresh recording when switching spoken languages if mixed speech gets truncated.
4. Check names, numbers, code identifiers and negations before pasting the result into an agent. Optional LLM cleanup can improve formatting but can also change meaning; compare it with the raw transcript.

Copyable [transcription and cleanup prompts](../Prompt%20examples/Handy.computer%20-%20transcription%20prompts.md) are provided separately. Local ASR and cloud LLM cleanup have different data boundaries: enabling remote cleanup sends transcript text to that provider.

## How to compare models on your own voice

Use the same microphone and saved synthetic recordings for each model: natural Polish with diacritics, English spoken in your own accent, developer names and numbers, and a separate translation sample. Include negations and one mixed-language sample. Write a reference transcript first; score word errors separately from punctuation and translation fidelity. Record the app version, model, quantization, accelerator, audio duration and processing time. Repeat several samples before choosing a model.

The original unsourced model rankings, catalog speed/accuracy scores and claims of zero hallucination risk are omitted from this reviewed note. They did not establish which model works best for a particular speaker.
